This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in R related to subsetting data frames when NA values are present.  The `bug.r` file shows the problematic code, which produces an unexpected output due to the way R handles logical indexing with NA values. The `bugSolution.r` file provides a corrected version, highlighting the best practice for handling such scenarios.  This is a subtle bug that can be easily overlooked but can lead to significant errors in data analysis. The issue is explained in detail in the comments within the code files. This example is useful for understanding how to correctly handle NA values when subsetting data in R, a crucial aspect of data manipulation.
