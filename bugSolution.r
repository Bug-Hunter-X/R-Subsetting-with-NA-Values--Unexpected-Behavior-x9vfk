```r
# The issue stems from the fact that any comparison involving NA returns NA,
# leading to unexpected results when subsetting.  We need to explicitly
# handle NA values using the `is.na()` function.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, NA, 4), b = c(5, 6, 7, 8))

# Correct way to subset:
correct_subset <- df[df$a > 2 & !is.na(df$a), ]
print(correct_subset)

# Alternative using subset function:
correct_subset_subset <- subset(df, a > 2 & !is.na(a))
print(correct_subset_subset)
